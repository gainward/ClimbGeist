# Google App Engine Go Boilerplate

## About

This project aims to give developers an easy to use boilerplate project that can
easily jumpstart projects utilizing App Engine and Go.

## Features

* Preliminary backend boilerplate taken care of!
* Directory structure supports applications with backend/frontend architecture,
  using RPC calls to go between.
* Built in support for Closure.
* Generic build and deploy system.

## Usage

### Backend Changes

Do nothing; App Engine should pick up your edits and recompile automatically

### Frontend Changes

* Run build.sh, which will use Closure to compile the JS and set things up to
  serve.

## Deploying to App Engine

## TODO

* Build out frontend portion
